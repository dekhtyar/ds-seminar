# Data Science Seminar
## Winter 2021
## Overview

This is a seminar for the Cal Poly Data Science Fellows. We will meet weekly over Zoom on MWF. 

Mondays:
* Reading discussions
* Discussions will be held in three breakout rooms, 6 students per room. 
* Each student receives a designated role for each reading: "presenter", "supporter", "opponent".  Each breakout room will have two presenters, two supporters and two opponents.  
* Discussions start with presenters giving a succinct and fact-based summary of the reading material. then supporters will discuss what they liked in the reading material. After that, opponents will critique the work. Following this scripted discussion, there will be additional time for back and forth between all students, and for faculty reflections on the reading material.

## Grading

Please enroll in DATA 472 for 1 unit, on a CR/NC grading basis.

To earn a CR grade, you are expected to:

- attend all seminars
- complete readings and post a question or comment about the reading to the Slack channel

## Readings

The theme of the readings for Winter 2021 is **the present**.

### Week 5

Topic: Dealing With Small Data

On the heels of some of our previous conversations about data science hype often going hand-in-hand with big data hype, it seemed appropriate to spend a little more explicit time on non-big data situations. This is a popular blog and probably worth an exploration beyond this article. There could actually be quite a bit to unpack with this reading. I (Glanz) challenge the "supporters" and "opposers" to really go at it with this one...Here are some starting questions, but don't feel restricted to just these.

* What, if any, explicit and/or implicit assumptions is the author making when proposing each tip?
* What are the pros and cons of each tip?
* If your dataset is small and there's not much to do about the size, can you really call your work with it "data science"?

Reading:

* [7 Tips for Dealing With Small Data](https://towardsdatascience.com/7-tips-for-dealing-with-small-data-7ffbd3d399a3)

### Week 4
Topic: Underspecification of Neural Network Models

A machine learning pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training
domain. The paper discusses how this results in diminished accuracy on different real-world verification sets and possible solutions to address the problem.

* D'Amour, A. et al. (2020).  [Underspecification Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning](https://github.com/dlsun/ds-seminar/blob/master/readings/2011.03395.pdf).  



### Week 3
Topic: Data vs. Theory

Intro to reading: In 2008, Chris Anderson, then editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, published a provocative editorial entitled "The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete."  He essentially argues that traditional methods of scientific discovery and business strategy are inferior in comparison to what can be achieved with data mining on large-scale datasets.  This is a fundamentally attractive idea -- that through big data, we can leave behind human-constructed models and theories about the way the world works, and instead discover directly from the data all the answers we need.  There are clearly many examples of where data-driven methods have prevailed over traditional hand-crafted alternatives, and all of you must "believe in data" somewhat based on your choice of academic field to study!  But, what is missing in Anderson's discussion of the promise and successes of big data?  Is data really all we need?  And when might data lead us astray?  

Note that this article has almost 2,500 citations on Google Scholar and is widely discussed in followup blog posts and magazine articles -- you might want to search a bit to find some different perspectives on this bold idea.

### Week 2
Topic: Bias and Fairness of Rankings and Recommendations

Introduction to Readings: Rankings and recommendation systems are everywhere. We take them for granted. We base a lot of big and small decisions on the results presented to us. The readings below share several themes. At their heart they are examples of models and systems that have unintended and possibly detrimental impacts on society. When you are reading them, please think about things the original designers could/should have done differently. Put yourselves in their position, and think about whether you would have forseen or anticipated any of the results or problems. Think about how you can design and study the many different models of that recommend a
nd rank items for you. Did the paper (third link) present a reasonable approach to studying a black box? What faults do you find if any? What could be done with their
 findings? What did the designers of both the studies and the original systems do well (i.e., think about the positive as well as the negative).

Questions to consider:
* Is the Turing Test a good test of whether a machine is intelligent?
* Are today’s systems (like IBM Watson, Google’s image recognition systems, etc.) intelligent?  Could a convolutional neural network be intelligent?
* In trying to achieve machine intelligence, should we try to mimic the brain or should we apply a pure engineering approach?
* Is the brain just a computer – could its functionality be replicated by a machine?

### Week 10
reading: D. I. HOLMES and R. S. FORSYTH, "The Federalist Revisited: New Directions in Authorship Attribution" [PDF](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.890.8767&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

In 1964 Mosteller and Wallace showed how statistics (and Bayesian analysis) can be applied to the problem of authorship attribution, and by implication stylometry (understanding, measuring and detecting "style"). Holmes and Forsyth built on that work in the 1990s, laying the foundations for more computationally intensive methods of behavioral analysis that has major implications in our lives in 2020s. Here are some motivating questions for the discussion this week:

- What are the parameters for the authorship attribution problem?
- Do you think there's a definitive style of writing associated with each person? Can that style be faked? 
- How has computational stylistics changed in the recent decades?
- How does the 1964 work on Federalist Papers relate to your personal life today?
-
