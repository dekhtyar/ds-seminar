# Data Science Seminar
## Fall 2021
## Overview

This is a seminar for the Cal Poly Data Science Fellows. We will meet weekly over Zoom on MWF. 

Mondays:
* Reading discussions
* Discussions will be held in three breakout rooms, 6 students per room. 
* Each student receives a designated role for each reading: "presenter", "supporter", "opponent".  Each breakout room will have two presenters, two supporters and two opponents.  
* Discussions start with presenters giving a succinct and fact-based summary of the reading material. then supporters will discuss what they liked in the reading material. After that, opponents will critique the work. Following this scripted discussion, there will be additional time for back and forth between all students, and for faculty reflections on the reading material.

## Fall 2020

## Overview

This is a seminar for the Cal Poly Data Science Fellows. We will meet weekly over Zoom on Thursdays. There are two 
sessons: at 10 AM and at 3 PM. You only need to attend one of these sessions. Each week there will be some readings 
relevant to data science, which we will discuss for 30 minutes. Afterwards, individual fellows will give updates on 
their research projects.

## Readings

The theme of the readings for Fall 2020 is **the past**.

### Week 1: September 17

No reading


### Week 2: September 24

Hypothesis testing is a core part of many statistics classes. But where did the ideas such as the p-value, Type I error, and power come from? This reading reviews the chaotic history of hypothesis testing in the 20th century.

### Week 4: October 8

We will look at the Frequentist vs. Bayes debate. Next week, you will be randomly assigned to defend either frequentism or Bayesianism. Please come prepared to 
defend both, although we want you to take a side in your Slack post this week.

- Andrew Gelman's blog post: [Why I Don't Like Bayesian Statistics](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/04/01/problems_with_b/). (This is an April Fools' Joke written by a famous Bayesian statistician. However, it contains some good ideas.)

### Week 5: October 15

A survey of the history of the connection between early statistics and the eugenics movement.

- [Scientific Priestcraft](https://github.com/dlsun/ds-seminar/blob/master/readings/Superior_Ch3.pdf) From "Superior: The Return of Race Science" chapter 3

Bonus reading from last week:  A metaphor for the difference between randomness and unknown-ness, and the consequences in Bayesian analysis.

Questions to consider:
* Is the Turing Test a good test of whether a machine is intelligent?
* Are today’s systems (like IBM Watson, Google’s image recognition systems, etc.) intelligent?  Could a convolutional neural network be intelligent?
* In trying to achieve machine intelligence, should we try to mimic the brain or should we apply a pure engineering approach?
* Is the brain just a computer – could its functionality be replicated by a machine?

### Week 8

No reading. Focus group with Lubi.

Given the timeframe there is no expectation that any supplemental materials will be read, but I want them available in a single place.

### Week 10
reading: D. I. HOLMES and R. S. FORSYTH, "The Federalist Revisited: New Directions in Authorship Attribution" [PDF](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.890.8767&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

In 1964 Mosteller and Wallace showed how statistics (and Bayesian analysis) can be applied to the problem of authorship attribution, and by implication stylometry (understanding, measuring and detecting "style"). Holmes and Forsyth built on that work in the 1990s, laying the foundations for more computationally intensive methods of behavioral analysis that has major implications in our lives in 2020s. Here are some motivating questions for the discussion this week:

- What are the parameters for the authorship attribution problem?
- Do you think there's a definitive style of writing associated with each person? Can that style be faked? 
- How has computational stylistics changed in the recent decades?
- How does the 1964 work on Federalist Papers relate to your personal life today?
-
